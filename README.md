## Introduction  

Do you remember when you planted the apple tree? Do you know when to water and fertilize your plants? MyPlantDiary can help you:  

- Record dates and locations where you planted plants.
- Take and view photos of a plant throughout its life.
- Record when you added water, fertilizer, and other amendments.
- Be aware of upcoming events for a plant: when to water, when growing season ends, etc.  

Use your Android device to create your own plant diary. Take photos with the on-device camera. Create reminders based on what you did in previous years. Receive alerts about upcoming events for your plant.
